0.0.1-beta1 (February 5, 2021)
 - Initial public release. It includes common modules to the SDKs for the different Javascript runtime environments, such as Browser JS SDK.
 - It has a modular design with the following goals:
   - Decouple the SDK API variants from the runtime environment, in order to, for example, run a client-side SDK instance on Node or Electron.
   - Size reduction via tree-shaking with ES modules.
   - Better performance by ussing the native APIs of each runtime environment.
   - Extendable via pluggable modules, such as storages, integrations with third-party analytic tools, etc.
