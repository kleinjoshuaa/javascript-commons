0.1.0 (March 30, 2021)
 - Initial public release. It includes common modules to be consumed by the different Split implementations written in JavaScript. Based on the original JS SDK in the `javascript-client` repository.
 - It's designed with a modular approach, with the following goals in mind:
   - Dependents should be able to include the modules that are needed for, as an example, a storage.
   - Dependents should be able to use the module that's specific for their runtime environment, allowing for better usage of native APIs as well as to build optimizations targeted by each platform.
   - Size reduction should be applicable when possible.
   - Design should be extensible, specially for modules that act as an orchestrator.
   - Code reusability.
